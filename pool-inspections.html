                    <p>Our licensed Pool Safety Inspectors at Cityone Building Inspections are committed to work with
                        you, the pool owner, to ensure your pool meets the Queensland swimming pool safety standards.
                    </p>

                    <p>The swimming pool safety standard is set by the Queensland Government and designed to minimise
                        the chance that young children can get into the pool area unsupervised.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-5">Why You Need a Professional Swimming Pool Inspection?</h3>
                    <p>As a swimming pool and SPA owner in Queensland, you must:</p>
                    <ul class="custom-list">
                        <li>Have a Pool Safety Certificate confirming that your pool is compliant with pool safety
                            standards at the time it was checked by a licenced inspector.</li>
                        <li>Register your pool with the Queensland Building and Construction Commission (QBCC). You can
                            click this link to register your pool: register. The pool safety register includes a record
                            of pools in Queensland and pool safety certificates issued.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In addition, a Pool Safety Certificate is required if you are buying, selling or leasing your
                        property with a pool.</p>
                    <p>You may also want to get a pool safety certificate for peace of mind.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-5">Cityone swimming pool inspection looks at:</h3>
                    <ul class="custom-list">

                    <h3 class="mt-5">What Do We Inspect: The Pool Safety Standards?</h3>
                    <p>Pool owners are required by law to ensure that their pool is fenced and meets the swimming pool
                        safety standards. These standards cover the following areas:</p>
                    <ul class="custom-list">
                        <li>mandatory fencing height and strength</li>
                        <li>non-climbable zones</li>
                        <li>gates and their self-closing and self-latching abilities</li>
                        <li>preventing direct access from a building into a pool area</li>
                        <li>mandatory pool signage</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="mt-5">Best Building Inspection You Deserve</h3>
                    <p>When you get your building inspected, one of the most crucial things to know is if there are
                        there are any timber pests in the building</p>

                    <p>At Cityone Building Inspections, all building inspections are carried out by experienced licensed
                        inspectors with wide knowledge accumulated from all aspects of the building inspection industry
                        with structural engineering background. Checking a property typically begins with a site
                        inspection. This is an assessment of the site for any conditions that may have a negative impact
                        on any buildings or associated structures on the property (conditions conducive to structural
                        damage).</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-5">Re-inspection Process</h3>
                    <p>The pool owner will have 90 days to address all items that deem their pool non-compliant. Once
                        all issues have been rectified, we will be able to re-inspect the pool so a Pool Safety
                        Certificate can be issued.</p>

                    <p>The Pool Safety Certificate is valid for one year for a shared pool and two years for a

                    <h3 class="mt-5">Cityone Pool Inspection Process</h3>
                    <p>Upon engaging with one of our licenced pool inspectors, we will provide you with a POOL
                        PRE-INSPECTION CHECKLIST. This checklist has been created to assist property owners to ensure
                        pool safety standards are met prior to the inspection.</p>

                    <p>We will visit your property and conduct the pool safety inspection. Once the Pool Safety
                        Inspection has been completed, the pool will be assessed as Compliant or Non-Compliant.</p>

                    <div class="row mt-4">

                            <p>If your pool is not deemed compliant, then the owner will be issued with a Non-conformity
                                Notice (Form 26). The non-conformity notice will detail all the items needing correction
                                to meet safety standards. But there is no reason to worry, the Cityone Team Pool Safety
                                Inspectors will provide practical advices and help you with areas that required

                    <p>Pool inspection before the sale and purchase of the property is necessary to make sure that the
                        pool is in good condition and meets all the safety standards. The review should be done by an
                        expert who will check if the pool has been maintained and if there are any leaks or any other
                        signs of damage.</p>

                    <p>The person who wants to buy a house with a pool needs to make sure that the seller provides them
                        with all the information about the pool. This includes information about its maintenance if
                        there are any damages or leaks, if it has been treated for algae growth, etc. The buyer can also
                        request an inspection report from their independent inspector to ensure everything is in order.
                        You can connect with Cityone Building Inspections for the same.</p>
